php-yilar
=========

php-yilar was supposed to be another active record framework.

But for now it is a property frameword.


TODO
----

  * <notation> for meta data, for example for defining get and set methods
  * Actual database stuff
  * callback type support - I guess I missed that.
  * more test coverage
